Notes on solutions and potential improvements

## General

1. Generation script run results through black first!
2. Pre-submission hook

## day 1

Can we put the info in lists via a comprehension?

From reddit (not the most efficient but gives tips)

def part1(left, right):
    total = sum(abs(num_left - num_right) for num_left, num_right in zip(sorted(left), sorted(right)))
    return total


def part2(left, right):
    right_counter = Counter(right)
    total = sum(left_num * right_counter.get(left_num, 0) for left_num in left)
    return total

utility split and nums function would be useful    

## day 2

Took simple approach of copying array and trying all arrays with an element missing. More efficient (but logically more complex) to walk through and try combinations.

## day 3

Part b: hybrid of regexp and simple search. Could do by combining into a single regexp, or perhaps writing my own parser (or using a more generic parsing engine)
