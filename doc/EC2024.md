# Everybody Codes 2024

Notes on solutions and potential improvements

## General

(some of these apply to AOC too)

1. Naming convention inconsistent between part_N and testN. We use a/b for AOC. 
2. More generic dispatcher when parts have same code.
3. Some sort of way of tagging which puzzle has which feature (generic with AOC)
4. Get a logging library incorporated.
5. Sort out vec2d/3d (cacheable). Now done, but need to go back and edit prior code. Note: __hash__ to generate a hash value.
6. grid2d input is very inconsistent, particularly on whether we pass an input generator. Think about doing it more generically.
7. More generic arithmetic for vec2d/3d.

## Day 01

Obvious implementation. No issues.

## Day 07

input_generator issue as noted above.

part_2 and part_3 have distinct track parsers, but that's OK. 'S' goes at end.

Can logic for part_3 parser be tidier?

Constructed a recursive generator which is useful for future reference.

## Day 14

Another breadth-first search case.

Move some of the functionality into Vec3d. A move * N function would be useful.

## Day 15

Solution just about works inside memory limits. Worth trying a memory profiler to see what can be improved.

It would be good to have more generic maze-solving or breadth/first-solving code (day 13 has a similar method). Trying to work out why we have an it method.

Set of herbs found could be packed as binary or similar to save memory.

We optimise fairly crudely to reduce states where we have a set of vertical elements, or things round a lake.

Worth considering is breaking the maze into horizontal segments and having a transition level being links between these entrances and the new herbs picked up. Will want to factor out the groups of five (both end points only) and the case where we have a dead end in the wall.

The search between pairs of herbs would be more efficient done as a two way flood fill.
