## Day 24

Reasonably efficient algorithm (greedy setup). Worth trying to tidy up via an enum. Don't know if combining the two recursive functions would be better?

We can probably cull states by seeing if the top surviving numbers in total are too small. Might be better to maintain lists rather than states?

Everything runs in 0.20s on my test.
