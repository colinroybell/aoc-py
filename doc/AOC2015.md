# AOC 2015

## General

Nice (eg day 21) to be able to read from arbitrary file. 

## Day 21 

I munged file a bit to make it more parseable. Might be better ways to handle the two ring case rather than two separate Nones, but pretty fast regardless.

## Day 22

Needed to look at other solutions to debug (did when tired/ill). Look at tidying this up.

## Day 23

Just implemented what we needed for test input. Implements Collatz problem for two starting points.

## Day 24

Reasonably efficient algorithm (greedy setup). Worth trying to tidy up via an enum. Don't know if combining the two recursive functions would be better?

We can probably cull states by seeing if the top surviving numbers in total are too small. Might be better to maintain lists rather than states?

Everything runs in 0.20s on my test.
