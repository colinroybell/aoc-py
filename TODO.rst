TO DO 
=====

2025-11
* Various TODO lists scattered around now. Review
* docstrings and a means of tagging which ones are done, which ones are reviewed, notes. 
* can we do a local JIRA? Or use github issues? Can get a free JIRA board.
* sphinx set up - how do we use. Would be nice to have an autogenerated page per problem where we can put notes, TODOs etc.
* codysssi 2025 has only 18 puzzles, not 20. 
* general review of utilities etc.
* some kind of env variable for setting the current puzzle we are doing.


* Automatic input handler for string input. It is passed either a filename, or a list of strings, and we return an iterator
* Probable class hierarchy, which can give a prefix function for data (and other things if we need it)
* Utility functions for some general use cases - maybe survey 2015 for typical inputs?
* Work out pytest selection mechanisms/marking, and how to do things reasonably generically
* Find a good linting solution

* think about bringup vs functional vs regression testing.

pytest

pytest xfail is usual semantic for a test that is expected to fail, so think I'm fine at the minute for regressions. Having a pass for bringup tests is less good. Maybe have them commented out as a stub? Or skip?

Durations seem very random. Is there a more reliable means of timing?


Want a way of running the test1 variants easily
